**What is it?**
TailPlume is a link in Bio and Digital business card system, tailored towards people who visit conventions.

**Technologies used**
TypeScript, Node.JS, Vue 3, Vite, Docker

**Why are you developing TailPlume?**
After using other link in bio services I just wasn't happy with the way they handled customization, and many of the services I tried locked basic features behind a paywall. in light of this, I have decided to develop my own solution that is easy to use while offering a reasonable degree of customisation.

**Where can I find it?**
The landing page is currently visible here at [https://tailplume.io](https://tailplume.io) and you will be able to sign up once the application goes live.
